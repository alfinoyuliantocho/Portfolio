This notebook demonstrates a complete data-cleaning and exploratory analysis pipeline applied to an automobile dataset from Coursera. 
The goals are to prepare the data for analysis (handle missing values, fix types, and create derived features), validate data quality, and produce clear visualizations that reveal relationships between price, engine characteristics, and fuel efficiency. 
The analysis includes price segmentation, fuel-cost-per-mile calculations, and visual comparisons across brands and body styles to surface actionable insights.
